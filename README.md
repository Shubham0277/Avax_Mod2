## MyContract Solidity Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the MyContract Solidity smart contract. The contract allows users to interact with a simple cryptocurrency storage and manipulation system. It enables users to increase the cryptocurrency balance and view the current balance.

## Prerequisites

### Solidity Compiler: The contract is written in Solidity and requires a Solidity compiler compatible with version ^0.8.0.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

### a)Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyContract.git

### b)Compile the Contract: Use a Solidity compiler to compile the MyContract.sol file. You can use tools like Remix or Truffle for compilation.

### c)Deploy the Contract: Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network of your choice. You can use tools like Remix or Truffle for deployment.

Interact with the Contract: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its functions. The two main functions are:

a) additionCryptocurrency(): Increments the cryptocurrency balance by 1.

b) receiveCryptocurrency(): Returns the current cryptocurrency balance.

## HTML CODE

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

### a)Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ethereum-Mod-2.git

### b)Install Web3.js: Since the project uses Web3.js, you need to include the Web3.js library. You can do this by either downloading the library and referencing it in your HTML or using a content delivery network (CDN).

### c)Configure Application: Open the application.js file and replace the placeholders with your actual contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface). This information is required to interact with your deployed smart contract. The additionCryptocurrency and receiveCryptocurrency functions should be defined in this file to interact with your smart contract.

### d)Open the HTML Page: Open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see a webpage that allows you to interact with the smart contract.
